## Characters

### Ethan
Ethan appears in the hallway and is only visible by shining the flashlight. He will try to jumpscare you after some time, but will temporarily leave if fooled by the mask

### Michael
Michael is asleep in Ten Ren's (camera 1). Keep him asleep by winding the music box.

### Joseph
Joseph starts off in Popeyes (camera 3). He will move slowly between the three restaurants, but once he reaches Ten Ren's (camera 1) he has the ability to enter the vents (camera 4/5) which lead to the hallway. Use the mask to prevent him from jumpscaring you.

### Ryan
Ryan activates at 2AM. He will spawn in one of the vents (camera 4/5). Prevent him from entering the hallway by using the mask. Once Ryan enters, he will steal your flashlight.

### Katie
Katie will randomly appear as a ghost in the hallway. Quickly open your monitor to make her disappear.
